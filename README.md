# db-cluster

**AI-native federated database cluster.**

An AI system should not query one flattened database. It should operate over a cluster of specialized truth stores, where each store preserves its native truth shape and the cluster exposes one coherent retrieval, provenance, and mutation surface.

## What this is

A federated database cluster where:

- **Canonical store** — entities, IDs, stable state records
- **Artifact store** — raw files, documents, source text, generated outputs
- **Index store** — discoverability, full-text/vector lookup, metadata search
- **Event/provenance ledger** — actions, links, mutations, receipts, lineage

The kernel routes. The index discovers. The cluster owns truth.

## What this is not

- An AI database assistant
- An index over many stores
- Governance middleware
- A vector database with plugins
- An agent memory layer

## Architecture laws

1. Every fact has an owner store
2. Indexes are derivative — can be deleted and rebuilt from owned stores
3. AI never mutates raw state directly
4. Every answer traces to source truth
5. Every mutation crosses a typed command boundary
6. Artifact truth is immutable by default — corrections create versions, not overwrites
7. Kernel routes; cluster owns

## CLI

```bash
db-cluster init
db-cluster ingest ./source.md
db-cluster entity create ...
db-cluster find "..."
db-cluster inspect <id>
db-cluster trace <uri> [--direction] [--depth] [--graph]
db-cluster why <uri>
db-cluster lineage <uri>
db-cluster retrieve "..."
db-cluster trace-bundle "..."
db-cluster propose ...
db-cluster commit ...
db-cluster receipts
```

## Status

**Phase 7 — Policy, Permissions, and Trust Boundaries: COMPLETE.** 339 tests passing across 21 files.

The cluster now enforces policy, redaction, and existence boundaries across kernel, SDK, CLI, and MCP without leaking restricted truth or weakening retrieval, provenance, or command-gated mutation law. Every read path applies principal-scoped policy with deny-wins evaluation, existence-aware visibility, and structured redaction that preserves object shape without exposing restricted content.

Next: Phase 8 — TBD.
